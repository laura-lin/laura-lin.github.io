### Abstract: 


people’s mindfulness score,  trust, health situations, travel costs, knowledge of autonomous vehicles, and their willingness to change their travel mode are significantly related to their choosing autonomous paratransit as their preferred mode. 
Policymakers can focus on providing enough information about autonomous vehicles’ prices for people with low income and high travel costs. When design autonomous vehicles, people with high mindfulness level will be more acceptable to paratransit services.

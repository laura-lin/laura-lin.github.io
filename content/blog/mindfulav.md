### Abstract:

 
 This paper draws from people’s choices of different services in  autonomous vehicles to generate new insights about their acceptance of autonomous vehicles to meet their mobility needs. This article highlights the relationship between people’s mindfulness and their choice of the following applications of autonomous driving technology: self-driving-uber, car-sharing (Car2go), subway/rail, rental car, paratransit, self-owned autonomous car, self-driving car subscription, and self-driving bus. A quantitative analysis shows that in Chinese metropolitan areas, mindful people’s trust, health situations, travel costs, knowledge of autonomous vehicles, and their willingness to change their travel mode are significantly related to their choosing autonomous paratransit as their preferred mode. Travel costs have a significant effect on participants’ preference for autonomous vehicles. These findings indicate that using shared autonomous vehicles in paratransit services can improve high travel costs’ people’s trust in autonomous vehicles.

### Problem Statement

![city](/images/projects/city.jpeg)

People in China want to use autonomous vehicles, but restricted by color, price, type and different uses, we are still unclear about their preferences on autonomous vehicles. Such preferences  generate those questions: 

1. What kind of autonomous vehicles do people in the metropolitan areas like mostly in China?
2. What price will people accept when considering owning an autonomous vehicle or subscribe autonomous vehicles as long-term owner?
3. What different uses do people prefer when using autonomous vehicles?



### Research Method


1. Non-experimental pilot study
2. Qualtrics survey for data collection. 
3. Data analysis: R (Logistic Regression)


### Design process

After collecting data from Qualtrics survey, I used R and Logistic Regression for analyzing. Then I paraphrased the result with the statistical lanaguage and concluded the findings: 

1. Travel costs have a significant effect on participants’ preference for autonomous vehicles. These findings indicate that using shared autonomous vehicles in paratransit services can improve high travel costs’ people’s trust in autonomous vehicles. 
2. Price has significant impact on people's preference of different uses of Autonomous Vehicles in Chinese metropolitan area.
3. people’s mindfulness score,  trust, health situations, travel costs, knowledge of autonomous vehicles, and their willingness to change their travel mode are significantly related to their choosing autonomous paratransit as their preferred mode. 


### Result

Policymakers can focus on providing enough information about autonomous vehicles’ prices for people with low income and high travel costs. When design autonomous vehicles, people with high mindfulness level will be more acceptable to paratransit services.

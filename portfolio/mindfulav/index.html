Two publications of the project have been accepted by <a href=http://www.vehits.org/>VEHITS2021</a> and <a href=http://www.socav.org/>SoCAV2021</a>.</p><p>The keywords include: Autonomous Vehicles, Travel Behavior, Travel Costs, Trust, Income, Open to Change, Policy, Design.</p><h3 id=most-important-concepts-of-the-research-projects>Most important concepts of the research projects:</h3><p>Mindfulness</p><p>People absorb information more or less mindfully, much the same way as they act with differing degrees of self-reflection. Too often, individuals seize on standard classifications, use routine rules and procedures, and then proceed to become seduced by habits (Wayne et al., 2006).</p><p>Autonomomous vehicles</p><p>In recent years, many manufacturers and software companies announced that autonomous vehicles will be in the market shortly (Menno et al., 2016). One of the best advantages of autonomous vehicles is that full-autonomy can relieve human drivers of their responsibility to drive cars. However, not all people trust that autonomous vehicles are safe. This includes people with disabilities, such as visual impairments, who need additional accommodations to assure their safety.</p><p>Different Uses of Autonomous Vehicles</p><p>Self-driving bus
Self-driving subway or commuter rail
Self-driving paratransit service in the car
A rental self-driving car
A self-driving car subscription
A car-sharing self-driving car, like Zipcar or Car2Go
A self-driving car ride-sharing service, like a taxi, Uber, or Lyft
My self-driving car</p><h3 id=values-of-the-research>Values of the research:</h3><p>The project can help researchers/designers/policymakers to explore people&rsquo;s preferences on different uses of autonomous vehicles in the future. Mindfulness have several related well-being products, people&rsquo;s preferences can predict which kind of well-being technology related to mindfulness could be applied into autonomous vehicles. As intelligent transportation&rsquo;s development, user experience will be an important issue for Autonomous vehicles' companies.</p><h3 id=design-process>Design Process</h3><ol><li>Problem Statement</li></ol><p>As Autonomous vehicles (AV) develops, more and more public or private sectors like city council or companies will change people&rsquo;s mobility ways . Though AV can improve the safety of the accidents from human drivers' fatigue when people transit in the roads, many people still feel doubt about the safety issues. Stress of mobility has been a big problem for people, appearance of AV increases more uncertainty to people who may lacking knoledge of that.</p><p>Mindfulness is one of clinical behavioral threapies (CBT). People who take such intervention can learn to be more openess and accept the current moment, which will help them decrease stress level when behaving.</p><p>The two important concepts generate the following questions?</p><pre><code>1. Can mindfulness be provided to improve people's trust in autonomous vehicles? 
2. What other attitude variable will be important for people's trust in autonomous vehicles?
3. What kind of people will be more trust in autonomous vehicles?
</code></pre><ol start=2><li>Data Collection</li></ol><p>As autonomous vehicles is a very new word for most people, and prior research shows that people who have more information will be more mindful, thus we narrow down people into metropolitan areas in China.</p><p>We collected data (N=366) from people living in Chinese metropoliton areas participated the Qualtrics survey study.</p><ol start=3><li>Research method</li></ol><pre><code>Qualtrics Survey for data collecting;
Python Biogeme for data analysis;
R (Logistic Regression Model)
</code></pre><ol start=4><li>Results</li></ol><p>people’s mindfulness score, trust, health situations, travel costs, knowledge of autonomous vehicles, and their willingness to change their travel mode are significantly related to their choosing autonomous paratransit as their preferred mode.</p></div><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-around"><h3 class="mb-1 mt-1 text-left mr-4"><a href=/portfolio/mindful-avch/ title="People's Preferences for Different Uses of Autonomous Vehicles in China"><i class="nav-menu fas fa-chevron-circle-left"></i></a></h3><h3 class="mb-1 mt-1 text-left ml-4"><a href=/portfolio/av-vision/ title="Autonomous vehicles and visually impaired people's interaction"><i class="nav-menu fas fa-chevron-circle-right"></i></a></h3></div></main><footer class="mt-2 mb-4 text-center"><span class=markdownify></span><span>&#183;

Researchers want to know how can visually impaired people need when they use autonomous vehicles in the future.</p><h3 id=problem-statement>Problem statement</h3><p>Alhough there are several methods for visually impaired people to get help from the society, they still facing increasing difficulities when taking mobility tools like public transportation, Uber/Lyft or taxises. Orientation & Mobility (O&M) has been developed for 2 decades, and many people have been trained to help visually impaired and blind people&rsquo;s mobility, however, blind and visually impaired people&rsquo;s mental health and their dependent mobility have become a series problem. Some people felt hard to be accepted by the society since human drivers don&rsquo;t care about their difficulties and their needs of more accurate stop information, which is a big challenge of human-cented design.</p><p>Autonomous vehicles, as a new mobility technology, not only can release human drivers' pressure and improve safety rate for normal people, but also change people&rsquo;s behavioral system. When people use autonomous vehicles, it means people will only interact with machine, and no other people will help before and after you take the vehicles. Such &ldquo;non-human&rdquo; mode can bring blind and visually impaired people with &ldquo;no critique&rdquo; environment, and also can help their &ldquo;independent mobility&rdquo;. However, though tons of research have stated the benefits of autonomous vehicles for blind people, we still don&rsquo;t know how to specifically help them.</p><h3 id=research-method>Research method</h3><p>We used telephone interview and survey to ask people&rsquo;s preferences and attitudes of autonomous vehicles</p><h3 id=design-process>Design process</h3><p>I designed the survey with my advisor, and interviewed the participants. After the first round of interview, we adjusted the survey, and changed many questions to get more accurate answers.</p><h3 id=result>Result</h3><p>Since it is an ongoing project, and I am still working on it. The result will be shared once it is published.</p></div><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-around"><h3 class="mb-1 mt-1 text-left mr-4"><a href=/portfolio/mindfulav/ title="Mindful people's preferences on autonomous vehicles"><i class="nav-menu fas fa-chevron-circle-left"></i></a></h3><h3 class="mb-1 mt-1 text-left ml-4"><i class="nav-menu-disabled fas fa-chevron-circle-right"></i></h3></div></main><footer class="mt-2 mb-4 text-center"><span class=markdownify>short copyright message</span>
